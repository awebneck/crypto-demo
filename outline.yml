greetings
who I am
what I do
math nerdery
as little math as possible
caveats
  rules of crypto
  no security through obscurity
  security in the key, not the algorithm
  sidechannels - why it's hard
  cryptographers are people - heartbleed
what is crypto
  purposes of crypto
  confidentiality
  authenticity
  integrity
  non-repudiation
history
  scytale
  caesar cipher
  vigenere cipher
  modular arithmetic
  one-time pads
  polyalphabetic ciphers - turing & enigma
modern methods
  hashing
    hard to find a message that generates a given hash
    hard to find two messages that generate the same hash - birthday paradox
    hard to change a message without changing the hash
    attacks and salting
  symmetric ciphers
    XOR - example
    PRNGs - example
    stream ciphers - example
    block ciphers - example
      modes
        ECB
        CBC
        CTR
  asymmetric ciphers
    merkel puzzles
    diffie-hellman
    RSA
